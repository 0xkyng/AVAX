# CraftersToken

CraftersToken is an ERC-20 token implemented on the Ethereum blockchain using the Solidity programming language. This token is designed to serve as a utility within the Crafters community, allowing users to perform various actions such as minting, burning, and transferring tokens.

## Features

- **Minting**: The token owner can mint new tokens and assign them to a specified holder. This can be useful for various purposes such as rewarding users or initializing the token supply.

- **Burning**: Token holders can burn their own tokens, reducing the overall token supply. This can be used when users want to decrease their token holdings.

- **Ownership**: The token contract includes an owner variable, ensuring that only the designated owner (deployer of the contract) has the authority to mint new tokens.

- **Transferring**: Users can transfer tokens between addresses using the standard ERC-20 transfer functionality.
